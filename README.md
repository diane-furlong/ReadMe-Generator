## Description
    
    This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. The goal of this assignment is to create a README Generator in which a user is prompted with questions using the Inquirer npm to fill the contents of the README. The application then populates each field with the answers and creates the README.md file.

     
       The purpose of this homework assignment is to practice working further with node.js and npms.
