    ## Description
    
        This project is a CWRU Coding Bootcamp homework assignment. The goal of this assignment is to create a README Generator in which a user is prompted with questions using the Inquirer npm to fill the contents of the README. The application then populates each field with the answers and creates the README.md file.
